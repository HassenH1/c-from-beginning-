normal number system 372 means -> etc 3*100 7*10 2*1

binary numbers system 1011 means -> etc 1*8 0*4 1*2 1*1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11 only add the 1 not the 0

this is important because a computer memory is in cells 
each cell is called a bit 
each bit has two possible states 0 or 1 and you can represent binary number with it 

bits are organized into bytes 
a 8 bits is 1 bytes
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 8 bits => means is 1 byte
